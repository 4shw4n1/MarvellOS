# MarvellOS

## About
This is a basic operating system mock-up made from python GUI module Tkinter.
It has a few interactive apps to navigate through.

There are 2 main screens, apart from the various app screens.
At first, you're confronted with the welcome screen, where you're supposed to enter your password within 5 tries. On login, you enter the app drawer, where you can choose from a grid of apps.

## Setup and Usage
**Make sure you have python2 installed on your system. If not, download the latest version of python2 from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the MarvellOS.py file.
3. Initially enter *0000* as the password, which can be changed later.
